#Stack Overflow Clone

##Completed:

*As a user, I want to create an account.

*As a user, I want to be automatically signed in upon creating an account.

*As a user, I want to ask a question, so that I can get help with a programming problem I'm having.

*As a user, I want to answer a question, so that I can help somebody else out. I want to see my answer immediately on the page.

*As a user, I want to view a questions and its responses, so that I can get help if I'm having the same problem.

*As a user who didn't ask a question, I want to vote on which answer I think is best, so that higher-voted answers display higher on the page. (Currently, votes cannot be changed once cast. So, choose carefully.)

*As a user, I want to receive a confirmation email when I sign up, so I know I signed up properly.


##To be completed:

*As a user who asked a question, I want to choose the best answer, so that it is displayed before the other answers and future users see it first.

*As a user, I want to search questions, so that it's easier to find what I'm looking for. Hint: Use the Textacular gem for searching.

*As a user, I want my searches to also look through responses, to increase the chances of finding what I'm looking for. Try out: Create a PORO called Search that runs searches on Question and Response and combines the answers.

*As a user, I want to vote up questions I like, so that awesome questions get displayed higher on the list of questions and on search results. Hint: make votes polymorphic.

*As the designer, I realize that the site has gotten big enough I can't handle all of the questions/issues by myself. I need to assign certain users the ability to act as Administrators, handling more complex tasks or issues than regular users. I need to check out and implement CanCan.
